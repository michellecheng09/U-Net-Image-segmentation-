# Image Segmentation of Breast Cancer Ultrasounds using U-Net Architecture 

This project utilizes a convolutional neural network to perform image segmentation on breast cancer ultrasound images, including benign, malignant, and normal scans. The project implements the U-Net architecture to encode and decode image data for accurate segmentation, aiming to predict target masks for cancerous areas. This work has the potential to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis, ultimately improving treatment plans and patient care

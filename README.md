# Image Segmentation of Breast Cancer Ultrasounds using U-Net Architecture 

This project is focused on using a convolutional neural network to do image Segmentation on a set of breast cancer ultrasound images. The dataset is comprised 
of benign, malignant and normal patient scans. The purpose of this project was to explore the implmentation of the U-Net architecture to encode and decode image data to complete the segmentation. The goal is for the model to predict the target mask for cancerours areas in scan. This has the potential to aid healthcare professionals with earlier diagnosis to improve treatement plans and patient care.

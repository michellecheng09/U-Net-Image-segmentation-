# Image Segmentation of Breast Cancer Ultrasounds using U-Net Architecture 

This project is focused on using a convolutional neural network to do image Segmentation on a set of breast cancer ultrasound images. The dataset is comprised 
of benign, malignant and normal patient scans. The purpose of this project was to explore the implmentation of the U-Net architecture to encode and decode image data to complete the segmentation. The goal is to segmentation potentially cancerours areas in a scan to aid healthcare professionals with early diagnosis and to improve treatement plans and patient care.
